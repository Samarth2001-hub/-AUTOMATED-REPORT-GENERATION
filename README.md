This Python program automates the process of reading sales data from a CSV file, performing basic statistical analysis, and generating a professional PDF report. It uses the reportlab library to create a formatted document with tables and text, suitable for business reporting purposes. The script is designed to be modular, reusable, and adaptable to different datasets with a similar structure.
In this task of automated report generation I made the use of visual studio code for doing my coding.I installed the library known as reportlab from the command prompt by making the use of the pip command.The specification of this program is that it reads data from a CSV file with date, product, and sales columns.It performs basic statistical analysis (total, average, min, max, etc.).It creates a professional PDF report with:
a) Title and generation date
b) Summary statistics table
c) Detailed transaction table
d) Formatted tables with headers and gridlines 
It  includes error handling for file operations and it even uses reportLab for PDF generation with styling. 
ReportLab Libraries:
a) reportlab.lib.colors: For styling the PDF with colors (e.g., table backgrounds).
b) reportlab.lib.pagesizes: Provides standard page sizes (e.g., letter for 8.5x11 inches).
c) reportlab.platypus: Includes tools like SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, and Table for building the PDF structure.
d) reportlab.lib.styles: Provides predefined styles (e.g., headings, normal text) for consistent formatting.
Standard Libraries:
a) csv: For reading the input CSV file.
b) datetime: To include the current date in the report.
c) statistics: For calculating statistical measures like mean.
The output PDF for this program will have:
a) A header with the current date (April 6, 2025, in this case)
b) A summary section with key metrics
c) A detailed table of all transactions
d) Professional formatting with colored headers and gridlines

This program is a practical tool for automating report generation from structured data, ideal for small-scale business analytics or educational purposes.
